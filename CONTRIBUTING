# Contributing to Prompt Polish

Thank you for considering contributing to the **Prompt Polish** project! Contributions are welcome and appreciated. Whether you want to report a bug, propose a feature, or submit code, this guide will help you understand how to get involved.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- **Search for existing issues** to avoid duplicates.
- If you can't find a similar issue, create a new one.
  - Use a clear and descriptive title.
  - Provide as much detail as possible (steps to reproduce, expected behavior, environment, etc.).

### Proposing Features

- Open an issue to discuss your idea before submitting a pull request.
- Explain:
  - The problem your feature solves.
  - How it aligns with the project's goals.

### Submitting Code Changes

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

2. Ensure your branch follows the naming convention `feature/<name>` or `fix/<name>`.
3. Follow the project's coding standards.
4. Test your changes thoroughly.
5. Commit changes with a descriptive message:

   ```bash
   git commit -s -m "Add feature: Description of feature"
   ```

   (The `-s` flag ensures you sign off your commit for the DCO.)

### Pull Requests

- Ensure all tests pass locally.
- Submit your pull request with a clear description.
- Link relevant issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
- Each pull request must be signed-off for the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/).

### Development Guidelines
